- 👋 Hi, I’m @kufena
- 👀 I’m interested in software of many kinds.  I also like maths and physics but I'm not that great at these.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to love the UX - started with a bit of Blazor, moving on to React.  During lockdown I have done a number of courses on vector calculus and differential
equations, although some of that has gone.  I'm half way through a course on Numerical Methods for Engineers, again by Coursera.  I'd like to do the AWS Developer Associate exam,
as I really like the cloud.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, well, not sure really - not sure I know where to start.
- 📫 How to reach me?  Twitter under andydouglas1967, similarly for instagram.

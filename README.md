- 👋 Hi, I’m @kufena
- 👀 I’m interested in software of many kinds.
- I am now an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, working towards the AWS Certified Developer Associate exam.
- In the past, I have worked in research, and also commercially, largely with Java, MySQl and a JBoss container.  In 2008 I took time out to make pots for a living, although there
wasn't much of a living to be made.  I like wood-fired kilns and have built a few.  In between I moonlighted at a research company as a contractor, working in the .NET space.  I am looking to re-enter the
commercial arena again.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, well, not sure really - not sure I know where to start.
- 📫 How to reach me?  Twitter under andydouglas1967, and as andrewdouglas1967 for instagram.

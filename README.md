- 👋 Hi, I’m @kufena
- 👀 I’m interested in software of many kinds.  I also like maths and physics but I'm not that great at these.  Similarly, I like the IoT stuff, and have a number of boards
and sensors.  I like LoRa and LoRaWAN.  My most successful project - don't laugh - was getting a Raspberry Pi 2 to work as a remote machine, with a temperature sensor attached.
It uses an AWS Lambda to log data, and hopto for dynamic dns.

In the past, I have worked in research, and also commercially, largely with Java, MySQl and a JBoss container.  In 2008 I took time out to make pots for a living, although there
wasn't much of a living to be made.  I like wood-fired kilns and have built a few.  In between I moonlighted at a research company as a contractor.  Looking to re-enter the
commercial arena again, soon.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to love the UX - started with a bit of Blazor, moving on to React.  During lockdown I have done a number of courses on vector calculus and differential
equations, although some of that has gone.  I'm half way through a course on Numerical Methods for Engineers, again by Coursera.  I'd like to do the AWS Developer Associate exam,
as I really like the cloud.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, well, not sure really - not sure I know where to start.
- 📫 How to reach me?  Twitter under andydouglas1967, similarly for instagram.
